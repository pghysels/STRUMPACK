  (undocumented) METIS_NodeNDP routine. This can impact performance,
  or for some problems lead to stack overflow, but for others it
  drastically reduces memory usage. The old behavior can be restored
  with --sp_enable_METIS_NodeNDP.

 - The scalability of the sparse HSS preconditioner has been
   drastically improved. Extraction of elements (for the diagonal
   blocks and the B_ij generators) is now done for multiple blocks
   concurrently.
 - Add option to use Combinatorial BLAS approximate weight perfect
   matching instead of MC64. Only works in parallel, requires a square

 - Allow compilation without MPI (and ScaLAPACK, ParMetis..)
 - Add experimental support for Block Low-Rank compression, for both
   sparse (preconditioning) and dense. For now, this is only shared
   memory.

   whether OpenMP task dependencies and OpenMP taskloops are
   supported.

   this was not tested/used.

 - Added lots of doxygen documentation/comments. Removed the pdf
   manual, all the documentation is now online at:

   MPI and or OpenMP.
 - geometric nested dissection now supports wider stencils and
   multiple degrees of freedom per node (TODO add in MPI code)
 - Many performance and several bug fixes


Version 2.1.0 Released October 26, 2017
=======================================
 - Cleanup in the C interface.
 - Removed (set_)HSS_min_front_size and --sp_hss_min_front_size from
   the manual, it is not supported (yet)
 - In some of the examples, the PBLAS blocksize was set to 3 (for
   debugging). This has been removes, and the default blocksize of 32
   is now used, leading to much better performance for those examples.
 - Small bugfix in the adaptive HSS compression stopping criterion.
 - Disable replacement of tiny pivots by default. It can lead to
   convergence problems for large matrices.

======================================
 - Critical bug fix in HSS Schur complement update.
 - Some minor performance improvements.
 - Valgrind fixes, compiler warning fixes (when not compiling with
   OpenMP).


Version 2.0.0 Released October 1, 2017
======================================
This is a major revision. From now on STRUMPACK is released as a
single library, including both the sparse and the dense
components. Unfortunately, the dense code is not documented yet.
Additionally, the development version of the code is now available
from the public github repository
  https://github.com/pghysels/STRUMPACK

The main changes since release 1.1.1 are:
 - The options for StrumpackSparseSolver are now set through an object
   of type SPOptions, stored in the StrumpackSparseSolver class.
 - The template parameter for the real type has been removed. It is
   now derived from the scalar type.
 - The HSS code has been completely rewritten, performance is much
   improved, memory leaks and valgrind errors have been fixed.
 - A new, more robust adaptive HSS compression algorithm has been
   implemented. This was developed in collaboration with Theo Mary
   from Université Toulouse.
 - We have automated testing of the code.
 - Many bugs have been fixed. However, some bugs probably still
   remain. If you happen to encounter any problems while running
   STRUMPACK, please do not hesitate to contact us.
